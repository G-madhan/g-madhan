***STUDENT PERFORMANCE ANALYSIS***
STEP-1:
-->Data Cleaning and Preparation:
    1.Ensure Data Accuracy: Verify the data for errors, inconsistencies, or missing values.
    2.Standardize Data Formats: Consistent formatting (e.g., date, number) is essential for accurate calculations and visualizations.
    3.Create a Data Dictionary: Document the meaning and source of each data field to improve understanding and facilitate future analysis.
STEP-2:
-->Conditional Formatting: 
    Highlight specific cells or ranges based on certain criteria (e.g., top performers, underperforming students).
-->Data Validation: 
    Restrict data entry to specific values or formats to maintain data integrity.
STEP-3:
-->Pivot Table: 
    create a PivotTable, which is a dynamic table that allows you to manipulate and summarize our data.
-->Slicers and Filters: 
    Allow users to interactively filter and analyze data.
STEP-4:
-->Dashboard Design and Visualization:
    1.Clear and Concise: Use a clean and uncluttered layout.
    2.Effective Visualizations: Choose appropriate chart types (e.g., bar charts, line charts, pie charts) to represent different types of data.
    3.Color Coding: Use color to highlight trends, patterns, or outliers.
    4.Data Labels: Add data labels to charts for clarity and precision.
